Basic:
- from and import

Importing data from an external file
First, with a .txt file. 2nd, with a .csv file

1; example .txt:
---
ModuleA: Begin Data Transmit
ModuleB: Begin Data Receive
ModuleA: 1.2535
ModuleB: 1.2536
ModuleA: End Data Transmit
ModuleB: End Data Receive
---
say that this is saved as SampleRead.txt
and uploaded to the Connectport X2.

useful cmds:
- open, split, strip, append

1. Import appropriate libraries/modules
import os

2. Initial arrays to contain lines from .txt file
moduleA = []
moduleB = []

3. Use 'realpath' cmd in 'os' library to determine the location of the 'sample.txt' file.
b/c all files are uploaded to the Connectport online server,
it is assumed that 'zigbee.py' and 'sample.txt' occupy same location.

FullPath = os.path.realpath('accessTXT.py')

4. print path for user.
print "The location of SampleRead.txt is: %r" %str(FullPath)

5. Append 'FullPath' to the file name 'SampleRead.txt' to create a more
complete file name that may be used for access.

FilePath = '%s/SampleRead.txt' % os.path.dirname(FullPath)

6. Try to access file at 'FilePath' which is combination of 
'FilePath' and 'accessTXT'

try:

    7. Open the file
    RadioData = open(FilePath)
    # will have 6 elements due to each line of the txt file

    8. Examine each line of RadioData
    for EachLine in RadioData:

        # 9. Try to split EachLine by colon.
        try:

            # 10. Divide line into two parts
            (ModuleName, ModuleData) = EachLine.split(':', 1)

            # 11. Remove spaces
            Module Data = ModuleData.strip()

            # 12. Save data to appropriate radio using if statement
            if ModuleName == 'ModuleA':
                moduleA.append(ModuleData)
            else:
                moduleB.append(ModuleData)
        # Include ValueError
        except ValueError:
            pass
    # Close data file
    RadioData.close()
# Include exception
except IOError:
    print('Missing')

# Print results
print "Data transmitted by Module A includes:"
print(moduleA)
# same with B!

# call 'main' exec...
